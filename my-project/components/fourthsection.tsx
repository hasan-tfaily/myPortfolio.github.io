        Since beginning my journey as a freelance frontend developer over 1 year
        ago, I&apos;ve done remote work for agencies, consulted for startups,
        and collaborated with talented people to create digital products for
        both business and consumer use. I&apos;m quietly confident, naturally
        curious, and perpetually working on improving my chops one design
        problem at a time.
